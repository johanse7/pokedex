## Project Overview


This is a web application that interacts with a Pokémon list through the [PokeAPI GraphQL endpoint](https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/v1beta).  
It provides features such as infinite scrolling, filtering, favorites, and a user profile view.

## Relevant Technologies

This project uses a modern web development stack. The most relevant libraries for its functionality are:

- **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a rapid development environment.
- **React:** The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit:** standardized, efficient, and scalable state-management solution. It's used to manage the application's global state, such as favorites..
- **Apollo Client:** A powerful library for fetching, caching, and managing GraphQL data.
- **CSS Modules:** Modular CSS to scope styles locally and avoid collisions.
- **Playwright:** An end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows you to automate browsers and write reliable UI tests to ensure your app works correctly.
