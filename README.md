## Project Overview

This is a web application that interacts with a Pok√©mon list through the [PokeAPI GraphQL endpoint](https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/v1beta).  
It provides features such as infinite scrolling, filtering, favorites, and a user profile view.

## Relevant Technologies

This project uses a modern web development stack. The most relevant libraries for its functionality are:

- **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a rapid development environment.
- **React:** The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution. It's used to manage the application's global state, such as favorites.
- **Apollo Client:** A powerful library for fetching, caching, and managing GraphQL data.
- **React Virtual (`@tanstack/react-virtual`):** A headless utility for virtualizing large lists and tabular data. This library is key to the performance improvement you mentioned for the infinite scroll feature.
- **CSS Modules:** Modular CSS to scope styles locally and avoid collisions.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Playwright:** An end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows you to automate browsers and write reliable UI tests to ensure your app works correctly.
